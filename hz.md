# Refresh Rate and Response Time
Refresh rate can be thought as separating a video into pictures. The higher the rate is the more pictures are being projected every second. The standard for TV is 60hz. This means you are seeing 60 pictures every second. You can't notice it as you're watching because it seems like a normal video. For TV's you are fine with 60hz but if you want to be fancy you can bump it up to the next level at 144hz. Response time is how long it takes for your TV to react to an input. This is measured in milliseconds and this doesn't matter for everyday TV use.

### Gamers
Refresh rate and Response time are more important for gamers and can make or break a monitor choice. For a competitive gamer 144hz is almost necessary. At 60hz (same as 60fps which is what PS4 and Xbox One cap out at) you don't get a smooth enough experience for fast gameplay. For response time, anything over 1ms can become noticeable. For the average gamer, as long as you can't notice it you should be satisfied. Others want an edge on other players so they want even faster response times.
