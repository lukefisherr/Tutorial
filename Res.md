# Resolution
Resolution describes the dimensions of the pixels. Pixels are what you look at and what projects videos using colors. The most common resolution is 1080p (1080x1920 pixels). The more pixels you have the better your display will be. Images will look a lot clearer and sharper. With increasing viewing distance you can sacrifice resolution because you can't make out the pixels the farther away you are. Resolution also correlates to size. See the image below that compares resolution, size, and viewing distance to find the perfect resolution for you.
